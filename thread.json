Current holdings are: CDNS (1 share), SMCI (2 shares), BYD (1 share), SNOW (1 share), ALHC (1 share), DRRX (39 shares).\n3. CDNS, SNOW, and SMCI are down moderately from entry, while BYD has experienced a sharper drop.\n4. Today’s market is risk-on, driven by expectations of Fed rate cuts and strong tech momentum (TSLA and IDXX notable leaders). TSN (Tyson Foods) is also seeing positive movement, but is less volatile than tech.\n5. Selling BYD (worst performer) barely increases my cash, and selling both SMCI shares would only yield about $118.97 total (still not enough to buy TSLA, the strongest tech play today).\n6. Rotating out of current positions for today’s top gainers is impractical due to limited buying power.\n\n**Best Approach for This Session:**\n- Maintain existing holdings, prioritizing patience and potential for a rebound given today’s bullish market climate for tech and growth stocks.\n- Continue monitoring market volatility for better repositioning opportunities in the next session.\n- No trades will be made this cycle; focus will remain on risk management and seeking a better exit or entry for more meaningful portfolio growth.\n\n**Plan:** Hold all positions for now and wait for a more opportune moment to pivot capital, especially as volatility could create new opportunities in the next run.",
