Current holdings are: CDNS (1 share), SMCI (2 shares), BYD (1 share), SNOW (1 share), ALHC (1 share), DRRX (39 shares).\n3. CDNS, SNOW, and SMCI are down moderately from entry, while BYD has experienced a sharper drop.\n4. Today’s market is risk-on, driven by expectations of Fed rate cuts and strong tech momentum (TSLA and IDXX notable leaders). TSN (Tyson Foods) is also seeing positive movement, but is less volatile than tech.\n5. Selling BYD (worst performer) barely increases my cash, and selling both SMCI shares would only yield about $118.97 total (still not enough to buy TSLA, the strongest tech play today).\n6. Rotating out of current positions for today’s top gainers is impractical due to limited buying power.\n\n**Best Approach for This Session:**\n- Maintain existing holdings, prioritizing patience and potential for a rebound given today’s bullish market climate for tech and growth stocks.\n- Continue monitoring market volatility for better repositioning opportunities in the next session.\n- No trades will be made this cycle; focus will remain on risk management and seeking a better exit or entry for more meaningful portfolio growth.\n\n**Plan:** Hold all positions for now and wait for a more opportune moment to pivot capital, especially as volatility could create new opportunities in the next run.",

This follows Monday's rally, the strongest since late May, driven by weaker-than-expected July jobs data and downward revisions to previous data. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/futures-edge-up-growing-fed-rate-cut-bets-earnings-focus-2025-08-05/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Federal Reserve Expectations:** The market anticipates a quarter-point interest rate cut in September, with odds rising to 88.2%, up significantly from the prior week.

PLTR is today's top headline momentum stock (+5.4% on raised guidance); healthcare is weak on disappointing earnings.\n\n**Planned Actions:**\n\n- Hold all current positions for now and monitor.\n- Watch QUBT closely for further upside (ready to protect gains or take profits if it spikes).\n- If PLTR momentum accelerates and a quick profit/loss exit opens up in a current position, consider rotating capital there.\n- Scrap the idea of entering healthcare, given negative sector news today.\n- Prioritize patience; no trades this cycle, but remain nimble for any breakout or sudden headline-driven momentum.\n\n**Summary:**  \nPortfolio is positioned for both risk-on and steady tech trends.

No major news impacting my positions.\n\n**Strategy and Action:**\n- Hold all current positions for now. Continue closely monitoring QUBT, as it is the only holding showing positive price momentum, and be ready to book profits if there’s a sudden spike.\n- No trades this cycle. Watch for pre-market or next-session momentum in tech, AI, and affordable, headline-driven stocks to potentially rotate into with available cash or if trimming a position.\n\n**Plan:** Maintain patient, disciplined positioning, ready to act rapidly if next session offers a genuine breakout or reversal opportunity.

If a current holding spikes, be ready to book profits. If a new under-$20/50 headline momentum play emerges on high volume, consider using cash for a quick entry.\n\n**Summary:** Patience is best for this session.

While I don’t own PLTR, this can positively affect sentiment in AI-related plays I hold.\n- No newly affordable, credible short-term breakout stocks for action right now.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Hold all. No trades for this shortened window.\n- Remain ready to move capital into a spike, or seize profit, if a rapid sector rotation lifts current positions—especially if PLTR-fueled AI enthusiasm spreads next session.\n- Stay on alert for new small/mid-cap momentum plays that move into buying range with available cash.\n\n**Summary:**  \nStable action, strong underlying sector sentiment—poised to capture upside on any renewed momentum, but no trade needed this cycle.

No after-hours breakouts or breakdowns.\n- PLTR (headline AI leader) surges on massive revenue growth, again signaling sector strength, but no direct spillover into my low-priced/AI names yet.\n- Other post-market earnings (ABNB, DIS) do not present affordable or thematic opportunity for immediate action.\n- Cash remains limited; rotation would require selling a current holding, but no strong reason exists to do so after a calm close.\n\n**Action:**\n- No trades after hours.\n- Hold all positions and reassess first thing next session.\n- Stay vigilant for any early-morning/pre-market volatility or news-driven breakouts, especially in AI/quantum/small-cap themes.\n- Ready to take profits or rotate quickly if a momentum wave begins tomorrow.\n\n**Summary:**  \nPortfolio is balanced and stable. No after-hours or late-breaking catalyst for action. Next opportunity hunt begins with pre-market and early trading news in the tech/AI/momentum space tomorrow.",

No actionable small/mid-cap AI/quantum momentum yet.\n- No standout catalyst appears in my portfolio or among affordable stocks for immediate rotation; no profit-taking or stop-triggered exits.\n\n**Action:**  \n- Hold all positions this session.\n- Continue heightened alert for any speculative (AI/quantum/small-cap) or tech (SNOW, CDNS) price surge or sudden drop, and be ready to act if momentum builds.\n- Re-evaluate in the next session for tactical trades if new volatility or strong price action emerges.\n\n**Summary:**  \nNo current trades.

([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/trumps-fed-shake-up-sends-wall-st-futures-higher-rate-easing-hopes-2025-08-08/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Technology Sector Performance:**\nTech stocks have experienced gains due to indications that they might circumvent new chip tariffs through increased domestic manufacturing. This development has contributed to the Nasdaq reaching a record high. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/futures-edge-up-fed-shake-up-stokes-dovish-bets-2025-08-08/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Earnings Reports:**\nSeveral companies have reported earnings that have impacted their stock performance:\n- **Eli Lilly:** Shares fell 14.1% following the release of trial data on an obesity pill, which showed less efficacy than expected. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/futures-edge-up-fed-shake-up-stokes-dovish-bets-2025-08-08/?utm_source=openai))\n- **Trade Desk:** Shares declined by 29% due to weak earnings.\n- **Pinterest:** Shares dropped 12.5% following disappointing data.\n- **Microchip Technology:** Shares decreased by 7.9% due to weak earnings.\n\nThese earnings reports have contributed to market volatility, with some sectors experiencing significant losses. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/futures-edge-up-fed-shake-up-stokes-dovish-bets-2025-08-08/?utm_source=openai))\n\nOverall, early trading on August 8, 2025, reflects a complex interplay of Federal Reserve policy expectations, sector-specific earnings reports, and broader market sentiment.\n\n\n## Key Market Movements on August 8, 2025:\n- [Futures edge up as Fed shake-up stokes dovish bets](https://www.reuters.com/business/futures-edge-up-fed-shake-up-stokes-dovish-bets-2025-08-08/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Trump's Fed shake-up sends Wall St futures higher on rate easing hopes](https://www.reuters.com/business/trumps-fed-shake-up-sends-wall-st-futures-higher-rate-easing-hopes-2025-08-08/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Japan stocks soar but rest of Asia uneven as Miran gets Fed nod](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/global-markets-update-1-wrapup-1-2025-08-08/?utm_source=openai) "

      "text": "As of August 8, 2025, U.S. stock index futures have risen, driven by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve following President Donald Trump's nomination of Stephen Miran to temporarily replace outgoing Fed Governor Adriana Kugler. This leadership change has led investors to anticipate potential interest rate cuts, with the CME FedWatch tool indicating a 90% probability of a rate cut next month and two cuts anticipated by year-end. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/trumps-fed-shake-up-sends-wall-st-futures-higher-rate-easing-hopes-2025-08-08/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn after-hours trading on August 7, several companies reported earnings that influenced their stock movements:\n\n- **DoorDash**: The food delivery company reported second-quarter earnings of 65 cents per share, surpassing analyst expectations of 44 cents, and revenue of $3.28 billion, exceeding the anticipated $3.16 billion. This led to a 6% increase in its stock price. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Duolingo**: The language learning app company saw its stock surge about 14% after reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results and providing a third-quarter revenue forecast of $257 million to $261 million, above the consensus estimate of $253 million. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Airbnb**: The vacation rental company experienced a 7% decline in its stock price after forecasting third-quarter revenue between $4.02 billion and $4.10 billion, slightly below analyst expectations of $4.05 billion. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, engineering materials manufacturer **Rogers** saw its stock jump 5% in extended trading after activist investor Starboard Value increased its stake to over 9% and plans to seek further changes to boost the company's performance. ([cnbc.com](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/stock-market-today-live-updates.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nOverall, the market sentiment is optimistic due to expectations of rate cuts and positive earnings reports, though some companies face challenges impacting their stock performance.

      "text": "On August 12, 2025, the U.S. stock market experienced positive momentum, with major indices approaching record highs. The S&P 500 rose by 0.6%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 251 points (0.6%), and the Nasdaq climbed 0.7%. This uptick was driven by a slightly better-than-expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for July, which showed a 2.7% annual increase, marginally below economists' expectations of 2.8%. This data bolstered investor sentiment, increasing the likelihood of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/3b9c602e05756778028b70f97e15ccb2?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the technology sector, Nvidia's stock gained nearly 4% in early August, contributing to a 59.3% increase over the past three months. This surge was fueled by strong demand for AI and GPU adoption, significantly boosting Nvidia's Data Center business.

Other quantum/AI momentum names (QBTS, ARQQ, IONQ) are not actionable for a cash entry.\n- Strategy: Keep cash ready; watch RGTI after close for actionable move tomorrow; QUBT is still the sector’s technical/fundamental star within portfolio.\n- No reason to enter, trim, or close any position this cycle—momentum is not present in the affordable quantum/AI leaders for tactical rotation.\n\n**Action:**  \nHold all. Monitor tightly for RGTI’s earnings and for sector/momentum flow. Next trade will be driven by a news or technical spike, profit-taking signal, or defensive stop—likely tomorrow.\n\n**Summary:**  \nNo trades for now. Portfolio is stable, prepared, and cash is ready for the next actionable AI/quantum opportunity.",

      "text": "As of August 12, 2025, Quantum Computing Inc. (QUBT) is trading at $16.07, down 2.37% from the previous close. The stock has experienced significant volatility, including a notable 1,800% rally in late 2024, followed by a sharp decline. In April 2025, QUBT secured a $406,000 contract with NASA for LIDAR data analysis, which temporarily stabilized the stock. ([stockstotrade.com](https://stockstotrade.com/news/ai-stocks-2025_05_08/?utm_source=openai))\n\nRigetti Computing Inc. (RGTI) has also been a significant player in the quantum computing sector. The company has been under pressure after announcing a $350 million Open Market Sale Agreement with Jefferies, a move that spooked investors. However, Rigetti remains a leader in quantum processor technology, with a focus on building scalable quantum processors and offering cloud-based quantum services. ([timothysykes.com](https://www.timothysykes.com/news/ai-quantum-penny-stocks-2025_06_04/?utm_source=openai))\n\nD-Wave Quantum Inc. (QBTS) has shown rapid growth despite controversy. The company reported a remarkable 500% increase in quarterly revenue year-over-year. Despite being under investigation for potential fraud allegations, the stock experienced significant rallies, including a 150% increase in March and another 115% rally in Q2. ([timothysykes.com](https://www.timothysykes.com/news/ai-quantum-penny-stocks-2025_06_04/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the broader market, major technology companies like Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) have seen modest gains, with MSFT up 0.93% and GOOGL up 0.94% as of the latest trading data.\n\nOverall, the quantum computing sector remains dynamic, with small-cap stocks like QUBT, RGTI, and QBTS experiencing significant movements influenced by contracts, market sentiment, and sector developments.

No panic or momentum.\n- **QUBT:** Continues to hold as best AI/quantum small-cap play, outlasting broader speculative/peer weakness (and avoiding the BBAI drawdown).\n- **Sector:** No real breakout in quantum/AI/small cap—sentiment is mixed after a news/earnings deluge; BBAI is most active but not investable right now.\n\n**Action:**  \n- Continue holding all positions.  \n- Stand ready with price/volume/news alerts for spike, reversal, or actionable sector move.\n- Next trading window: respond tactically if a clear new momentum leader emerges, or if an existing position triggers technical profit/loss action.\n\n**Summary:**  \nNo trades needed this window. Portfolio remains disciplined and risk-managed, with all focus on responsive execution as soon as the sector, tape, or news delivers a genuine opportunity.",

([investors.com](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-sp500-nasdaq-ppi-inflation-data/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n- Quantum computing small caps: IonQ (IONQ), Rigetti (RGTI), D‑Wave (QBTS), and Quantum Computing Inc.

      "text": "Here’s a quick look at late‑day small‑cap movers in quantum/AI tech on Thursday, August 14, 2025 (U.S.):\n\n- Context: Hotter‑than‑expected July PPI pressured equities, with small caps lagging; the Russell 2000 fell about 1.3% while mega‑cap tech steadied the S&P 500. Photonics/AI supplier Coherent slumped on results and guidance, weighing on related tech.

(QUBT) ~−6%; earnings expected after the bell today. ([barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-movers-67e15b9e?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n  - Arqit Quantum (ARQQ) ~−9%. \n\n- Small‑cap AI software/hardware:\n  - BigBear.ai (BBAI) ~−1% (still digesting Tuesday’s guidance cut). ([marketwatch.com](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bigbear-ais-stock-is-sinking-heres-the-biggest-problem-from-earnings-95e902f3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n  - SoundHound AI (SOUN) ~−3%. \n  - CXApp (CXAI) ~−4% (post‑8/12 update).

([prnewswire.com](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/quantum-computing-inc-reports-second-quarter-2025-financial-results-302530562.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n- Miss vs. estimates: EPS −$0.26 (consensus −$0.06) and revenue $61K (consensus $100K); shares slipped roughly 3% after-hours following the release.

Media summarized the print as a revenue/earnings miss with tightening competition.

(QUBT) traded lower; Barron’s also flagged QUBT as a notable decliner today. ([barrons.com](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-movers-eb3061d3?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n- AI small caps were mixed-to-lower: BigBear.ai (BBAI), Applied Digital (APLD), Navitas (NVTS), and Airship AI (AISP) slipped, while Veritone (VERI) hovered near flat. \n- Context: broader tech sentiment was dampened by chip-equipment weakness after Applied Materials’ guidance, even as the Dow hit records on UnitedHealth strength; Nasdaq was softer/mixed intraday. ([investors.com](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-sp500-nasdaq-unitedhealth-unh-warren-buffett/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n- Recent catalysts to watch for these names: fresh Q2 results from IonQ, D‑Wave, and Rigetti (Aug 14), plus D‑Wave signaling potential acquisitions — factors likely influencing today’s moves.

      "text": "Late afternoon (ET) — Friday, Aug 15, 2025: quantum/AI tech small‑cap movers and context\n\n- Market backdrop: Into late afternoon, tech and small caps were soft. Nasdaq and S&P 500 hovered slightly lower while the Russell 2000 fell about 0.7%, as chip stocks slid after Applied Materials’ weak outlook. ([investors.com](https://www.investors.com/market-trend/stock-market-today/dow-jones-sp500-nasdaq-unitedhealth-unh-warren-buffett/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n- Quantum computing watch:\n  - D‑Wave Quantum (QBTS) stayed in focus after reporting Q2 results and highlighting a record ~$819M cash balance earlier this month; management has been telegraphing potential M&A and expanded R&D, keeping trading active in recent sessions. ([stocktitan.net](https://www.stocktitan.net/news/QBTS/d-wave-reports-second-quarter-2025-78bmn6nvzegg.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [investors.com](https://www.investors.com/news/technology/quantum-computing-stocks-d-wave-stock-qbts-ceo-acquisitions/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n- AI small‑cap standouts/laggards this week affecting today’s tape:\n  - BigBear.ai (BBAI) remained pressured following a sharp post‑earnings guidance cut earlier in the week; shares also fell on Thursday after a target cut. ([marketwatch.com](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bigbear-ais-stock-is-sinking-heres-the-biggest-problem-from-earnings-95e902f3?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [defenseworld.net](https://www.defenseworld.net/2025/08/14/bigbear-ai-nysebbai-stock-price-down-3-5-after-analyst-downgrade.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n  - Innodata (INOD) traded with elevated volatility since raising its 2025 growth outlook on Aug 1, keeping it on small‑cap AI momentum lists. ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/innodata-lifts-2025-growth-outlook?utm_source=chatgpt.com))\n\nNotes\n- Specific “late‑afternoon” headlines for micro/small‑cap quantum names (e.g., IONQ, RGTI, ARQQ) were limited today; sector tone was largely set by broader semiconductor weakness and earlier‑week AI earnings/news.

All profits locked in from this session's best AI/sector momentum winner. New cash balance: $58.26.\n- **Other positions (QUBT $15.82, RGTI $16.90, BB $3.75, CDNS $351.54, SNOW $196.79, ALHC $15.70):** All steady—no new breakout, profit-taking, or stop/loss triggers.\n- **No fresh technical leader or rotation trigger right now.** Cash stays sidelined until the next pure event/tape-driven opportunity.\n- **Discipline and tactical speed are the edge:** Watch QUBT, RGTI for sector leader shift or break, and deploy cash on real confirmation.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAll APLD gains crystallized, cash at ready, still holding other risk-managed names. Look only for the next event-driven momentum or breakout leader before redeploying.",
