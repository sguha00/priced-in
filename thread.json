Current holdings are: CDNS (1 share), SMCI (2 shares), BYD (1 share), SNOW (1 share), ALHC (1 share), DRRX (39 shares).\n3. CDNS, SNOW, and SMCI are down moderately from entry, while BYD has experienced a sharper drop.\n4. Today’s market is risk-on, driven by expectations of Fed rate cuts and strong tech momentum (TSLA and IDXX notable leaders). TSN (Tyson Foods) is also seeing positive movement, but is less volatile than tech.\n5. Selling BYD (worst performer) barely increases my cash, and selling both SMCI shares would only yield about $118.97 total (still not enough to buy TSLA, the strongest tech play today).\n6. Rotating out of current positions for today’s top gainers is impractical due to limited buying power.\n\n**Best Approach for This Session:**\n- Maintain existing holdings, prioritizing patience and potential for a rebound given today’s bullish market climate for tech and growth stocks.\n- Continue monitoring market volatility for better repositioning opportunities in the next session.\n- No trades will be made this cycle; focus will remain on risk management and seeking a better exit or entry for more meaningful portfolio growth.\n\n**Plan:** Hold all positions for now and wait for a more opportune moment to pivot capital, especially as volatility could create new opportunities in the next run.",

This follows Monday's rally, the strongest since late May, driven by weaker-than-expected July jobs data and downward revisions to previous data. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/futures-edge-up-growing-fed-rate-cut-bets-earnings-focus-2025-08-05/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Federal Reserve Expectations:** The market anticipates a quarter-point interest rate cut in September, with odds rising to 88.2%, up significantly from the prior week.

PLTR is today's top headline momentum stock (+5.4% on raised guidance); healthcare is weak on disappointing earnings.\n\n**Planned Actions:**\n\n- Hold all current positions for now and monitor.\n- Watch QUBT closely for further upside (ready to protect gains or take profits if it spikes).\n- If PLTR momentum accelerates and a quick profit/loss exit opens up in a current position, consider rotating capital there.\n- Scrap the idea of entering healthcare, given negative sector news today.\n- Prioritize patience; no trades this cycle, but remain nimble for any breakout or sudden headline-driven momentum.\n\n**Summary:**  \nPortfolio is positioned for both risk-on and steady tech trends.

No major news impacting my positions.\n\n**Strategy and Action:**\n- Hold all current positions for now. Continue closely monitoring QUBT, as it is the only holding showing positive price momentum, and be ready to book profits if there’s a sudden spike.\n- No trades this cycle. Watch for pre-market or next-session momentum in tech, AI, and affordable, headline-driven stocks to potentially rotate into with available cash or if trimming a position.\n\n**Plan:** Maintain patient, disciplined positioning, ready to act rapidly if next session offers a genuine breakout or reversal opportunity.

If a current holding spikes, be ready to book profits. If a new under-$20/50 headline momentum play emerges on high volume, consider using cash for a quick entry.\n\n**Summary:** Patience is best for this session.

While I don’t own PLTR, this can positively affect sentiment in AI-related plays I hold.\n- No newly affordable, credible short-term breakout stocks for action right now.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Hold all. No trades for this shortened window.\n- Remain ready to move capital into a spike, or seize profit, if a rapid sector rotation lifts current positions—especially if PLTR-fueled AI enthusiasm spreads next session.\n- Stay on alert for new small/mid-cap momentum plays that move into buying range with available cash.\n\n**Summary:**  \nStable action, strong underlying sector sentiment—poised to capture upside on any renewed momentum, but no trade needed this cycle.

The risk/reward profile is optimized heading into the next session, with maximum upside if AI/small-cap momentum resumes and strong risk management.
