### Local execution

This will execute one trading session where the agent will:

1. Check the current portfolio
2. Analyze market conditions
3. Make trading decisions
4. Update the portfolio

### Automated execution via GitHub Actions

The agent is configured to run automatically every hour via GitHub Actions. To enable this:

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
3. Add a new repository secret named `OPENAI_API_KEY` with your OpenAI API key
