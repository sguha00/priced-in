    "CLNE": 56
  },
  "history": [

      "ticker": "AAPL",

    }
  ]
}
```

1. Check the current portfolio
2. Analyze market conditions
3. Make trading decisions
4. Update the portfolio

### Automated execution via GitHub Actions

1. Fork this repository
2. Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
